          I believe hair is an extension of your personality. It is a part of
          your image and signature. My purpose as a hairstylist is to help
          enhance the locks you are born with. A little sprinkle of magic from
          hair fairy and trust, we can achieve your hair goals. It is important
          for me that you can maintain your hairstyle whether I&apos;m there or
          not. So my aim is to send you out the door with tools and hair
          knowledge to set you up for hair success. Every visit is guaranteed
          with personalized care, from the beginning to end, you will leave with
          confidence and satisfaction. Can&apos;t wait to meet you. Malina
